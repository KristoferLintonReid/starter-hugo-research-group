Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death in women from a gynaecological malignancy. The poor prognosis of ovarian cancer is underpinned by the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Early diagnosis is fundamental to improving ovarian cancer survival. Globally, ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for evaluating the adnexa. Ultrasound is subjective and therefore open to error. Whilst robust ultrasound based diagnostic models exist, they still require expertise in ultrasound. Accurate adnexal mass classification is fundamental to ovarian cancer diagnosis.

We are evaluating the application of machine learning (Deep Learning and Radiomics) in the classification of adnexal masses on ultrasound. We have demonstrated comparable performance of a ML based model to an expert ultrasound examiner, we have an objective tool capable of supporting the classification of adnexal masses globally, which translates to improved ovarian cancer diagnosis and overall outcomes.

Our international team combines leaders in the field of Radiomics and Deep Learning (Prof Eric Aboagye, Kristofer Linton-Reid), Gynaecology Ultrasound (Prof Tom Bourne, Dr Maya Al-Memar, Dr Chiara Landolfo, Dr Jen Barcroft), Gynaecology Oncology (Dr Srdjan Saso, Prof Savelli, Prof Sara Lee) and Radiology (Dr Nishat Bharwani).
